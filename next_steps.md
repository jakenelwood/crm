   - Implement error handling for document generation

3. **Complete Secure Frontend-Backend Integration**
   - Update frontend API calls to use HTTPS endpoints
   - Implement JWT authentication for API access
   - Test document generation from frontend
   - Verify document history display
   - Test secure document download functionality

### Priority 2: Testing and User Experience
1. **Test Application in Production Environment**
   - Verify SSL certificate validity and security headers
   - Create test clients with realistic data
   - Generate sample quote requests
   - Test form submissions with real data through HTTPS
   - Test application on multiple browsers and devices

2. **Enhance User Experience**
   - Add progress indicators for multi-step forms
   - Improve form validation feedback
   - Add auto-save indicators with network status
   - Display clear success/error messages
   - Implement basic search functionality

### Priority 3: User Testing Preparation
1. **Create User Testing Plan**
   - Identify initial test users
   - Create user testing script with key workflows
   - Prepare feedback collection form
   - Schedule initial testing sessions

2. **Prepare Documentation**
   - Document common workflows
   - Create basic user guide
   - Document known limitations
   - Prepare troubleshooting guide
   - Create security best practices guide for users

## Required Resources

1. **Document Templates**
   - Ensure all templates are correctly formatted
   - Verify placeholders match expected format

2. **Test Data**
   - Create a set of test quotes for validation
   - Include edge cases (long text fields, special characters)

3. **Development Tools**
   - Docker and Docker Compose for deployment
   - LibreOffice for PDF conversion
   - Git for version control
   - SSL testing tools (e.g., SSL Labs)
