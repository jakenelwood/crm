# Quote Request Generator Implementation Plan

This document outlines the prioritized implementation plan for completing the Quote Request Generator project, focusing on delivering a functional MVP quickly and then adding enhancements.

## Phase 1: Core Functionality (1-2 weeks)

### 1. Deploy Backend Infrastructure
- [x] Set up Node.js API service on Hetzner server
- [x] Configure systemd service for automatic startup
- [ ] Implement Docker containerization for the API
- [ ] Set up LanceDB for data storage
- [ ] Configure basic endpoints for health checks

### 2. Document Generation
- [ ] Implement document templating with placeholders
- [ ] Set up LibreOffice for PDF conversion
- [ ] Create API endpoints for document generation
- [ ] Implement document download functionality
- [ ] Build document preview capability

### 3. Frontend Development
- [ ] Set up Next.js frontend with shadcn UI components
- [ ] Create multi-step form for Auto Quote Request
- [ ] Implement form validation and error handling
- [ ] Build document history and listing views
- [ ] Create document download UI

### 4. Integration & Testing
- [ ] Connect frontend to backend API
- [ ] Implement error handling for API failures
- [ ] Test document generation end-to-end
- [ ] Verify placeholder replacement accuracy
- [ ] Test on multiple browsers and devices

## Phase 2: Enhanced Features (2-3 weeks)

### 1. User Authentication
- [ ] Implement user authentication system
- [ ] Create user roles (admin, agent, etc.)
- [ ] Set up permission-based access control
- [ ] Build user management interface

### 2. Additional Quote Forms
- [ ] Implement Home Insurance quote form
- [ ] Create Specialty Insurance quote form
- [ ] Build UI for selecting form types
- [ ] Add form-specific validations

### 3. Data Management
- [ ] Implement saved drafts functionality
- [ ] Create client database and management
- [ ] Add search and filtering capabilities
- [ ] Build reporting and analytics features

### 4. UI/UX Improvements
- [ ] Enhance responsive design for mobile use
- [ ] Implement dark mode support
- [ ] Add guided form completion assistance
- [ ] Create dashboard with activity summary

## Phase 3: Advanced Features (3-4 weeks)

### 1. AI Integration
- [ ] Integrate LanceDB vector capabilities
- [ ] Implement smart form pre-filling
- [ ] Create document analysis features
- [ ] Build automated form recommendations

### 2. Production Deployment
- [ ] Set up Traefik for production routing
- [ ] Configure SSL certificates
- [ ] Implement proper CORS and security headers
- [ ] Set up monitoring and logging
- [ ] Migrate frontend to Vercel

### 3. Performance Optimization
- [ ] Implement document generation queue system
- [ ] Optimize database queries and indexing
- [ ] Add caching layer for frequent requests
- [ ] Implement progressive loading for large forms

## Implementation Notes

### Key Technical Decisions
- **Document Generation**: Use docxtemplater for template processing and LibreOffice for PDF conversion
- **Database**: LanceDB for initial storage with potential for vector search
- **Frontend State Management**: Use React Query for server state and React Context for local state
- **API Communication**: RESTful endpoints with proper error handling and status codes
- **Deployment**: Docker for containerization, Traefik for routing, systemd for service management

### Monitoring Progress
Track implementation progress in GitHub Issues, organizing tasks by:
1. Phase and feature area
2. Priority (Critical, High, Medium, Low)
3. Difficulty (Easy, Medium, Hard)

### Success Criteria for MVP
1. Users can complete an Auto Quote Request form
2. System generates a properly formatted document with all placeholders replaced
3. Documents can be downloaded in both DOCX and PDF formats
4. Basic form validation prevents submission of invalid data
5. System maintains a history of generated documents
