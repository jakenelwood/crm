# Implementation Order for Quote Request Generator

Based on our recent discussion and project analysis, here's the recommended implementation order for the Quote Request Generator project, with clear tasks and priorities:

## 1. Docker Implementation (1 week)

Docker provides the foundation for all components and ensures consistent deployment environments.

### Key Tasks:
- [x] Create Docker configuration for backend API
- [x] Update/validate frontend Docker configuration
- [x] Set up volumes for document storage and templates
- [x] Add LanceDB service to docker-compose.yml
- [ ] Test full stack Docker deployment locally
- [ ] Deploy Docker setup on Hetzner server
- [ ] Configure environment variables for production

### Resources:
- [Docker Setup Guide](docker-setup-guide.md)
- [Docker Deployment Guide](docker-deployment.md)
- Existing Dockerfile in backend directory
- docker-compose.yml in project root

## 2. LanceDB Implementation (1 week)

Implementing the database is a crucial step for data persistence before full application functionality.

### Key Tasks:
- [x] Set up LanceDB container and configuration
- [x] Create schema for quotes and client data
- [ ] Implement API endpoints for CRUD operations
- [ ] Build data access layer in backend code
- [ ] Set up backup/restore procedures
- [ ] Test data persistence and retrieval

### Resources:
- LanceDB documentation: https://lancedb.github.io/lancedb/
- [LanceDB Integration Guide](lancedb-integration.md)
- [Server Setup Guide](server-setup-guide.md) (LanceDB section)

## 3. Document Generation (2 weeks)

This is the core functionality of the application and should be implemented after the storage layer.

### Key Tasks:
- [ ] Implement document templating with placeholders
- [ ] Create document storage and retrieval functions
- [ ] Build PDF conversion capability
- [ ] Create API endpoints for document operations
- [ ] Test document generation with sample data
- [ ] Implement error handling for document processing

### Resources:
- [Document Generation Guide](document-generation-guide.md)
- Template DOCX files in repository
- placeholders.txt for placeholder mapping

## 4. Traefik Routing & SSL (1 week)

Production-ready routing and SSL setup ensures secure access to the application.

### Key Tasks:
- [ ] Configure Traefik as reverse proxy
- [ ] Set up automatic SSL certificate management
- [ ] Configure routing rules for all services
- [ ] Implement security headers and CORS
- [ ] Test access via domain names
- [ ] Set up monitoring for connectivity issues

### Resources:
- Traefik documentation: https://doc.traefik.io/traefik/
- [Server Setup Guide](server-setup-guide.md) (Traefik section)

## 5. Frontend Authentication (1 week)

Adding user authentication and authorization secures the application and enables user-specific features.

### Key Tasks:
- [ ] Set up Next.js authentication with Vercel solution
- [ ] Create login and registration pages
- [ ] Implement JWT token handling
- [ ] Build protected routes and components
- [ ] Create user roles and permissions
- [ ] Test authentication flow end-to-end

### Resources:
- Next.js Auth documentation: https://nextjs.org/docs/authentication
- [Next.js Authentication Setup](nextjs-auth-setup.md)
- Vercel Authentication solutions

## Implementation Approach

### Week 1-2: Infrastructure Setup
Focus on Docker and LanceDB implementation to establish the core infrastructure. This provides the foundation for all other components.

### Week 3-4: Core Functionality
Implement document generation and integrate with frontend forms. This delivers the primary value of the application.

### Week 5-6: Production Readiness
Set up Traefik routing, SSL, and authentication to make the application production-ready and secure.

## Success Metrics

To track progress effectively, use these metrics:

1. **Infrastructure Completeness**: All Docker containers running and communicating properly
2. **Data Persistence**: Successful CRUD operations with LanceDB
3. **Document Quality**: Proper placeholder replacement and formatting
4. **Security**: Successful SSL implementation and secure authentication
5. **User Experience**: Smooth form submission and document generation flow

By following this implementation order, you'll build a solid foundation before adding complex features, reducing the risk of architectural changes later in the project.
