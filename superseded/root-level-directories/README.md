# Root Level Directories

This directory contains directories that were previously located at the root level of the project and have been moved here during code cleanup and organization.

## Directories Overview

- **app/** - Next.js app directory from the root level
- **components/** - React components from the root level
- **docs/** - Documentation files
- **.next/** - Next.js build output directory
- **node_modules/** - Node.js dependencies
- **public/** - Public assets directory
- **supabase/** - Supabase configuration and migration files
- **superseded/** - Previously superseded files (now nested)
- **utils/** - Utility functions from the root level

These directories have been preserved for reference but are no longer actively used in the project. The main project directories are now located in the appropriate locations within the CRM folder structure.
