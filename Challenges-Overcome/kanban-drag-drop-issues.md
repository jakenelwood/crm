# Kanban Board Drag and Drop Issues

## Problem Description

The Kanban board in our CRM application had two significant usability issues:

1. **Lead cards not moving between columns when selected**
   - When attempting to drag a lead card from one status column to another, the card would not move with the mouse cursor
   - The drag and drop functionality was inconsistent, making it difficult to change a lead's status

2. **Modal not closing when clicking outside**
   - When a lead card was clicked to view details, the modal would open correctly
   - However, clicking outside the modal would not close it, forcing users to explicitly click the close button

## Root Causes

### Drag and Drop Issues

1. **Complex Click vs. Drag Detection**
   - The original implementation used a sophisticated but overly complex system to differentiate between clicks and drags
   - It relied on multiple timers, thresholds, and state variables that created race conditions
   - The code was trying to handle both click events (to open the modal) and drag events (to move cards) in the same component

2. **Restrictive Movement Constraints**
   - The drag and drop configuration had strict vertical movement restrictions
   - These restrictions were intended to guide users but made it difficult to successfully drag cards

3. **Sensor Configuration**
   - The pointer sensor configuration lacked appropriate delay and tolerance settings
   - This made it difficult to distinguish between a click and the start of a drag operation

### Modal Closing Issue

1. **Event Prevention**
   - The modal component had an `onPointerDownOutside` handler that called `e.preventDefault()`
   - This prevented the click outside event from propagating and closing the modal

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Simplified the LeadCard Component

We completely rewrote the LeadCard component with a simpler approach:

```typescript
// Track if we're in a click (not a drag) operation
const [isClicking, setIsClicking] = React.useState(false);

// Track when the mouse was pressed down
const mouseDownTimeRef = React.useRef<number>(0);

// Handle mouse down - mark as clicking and record time
const handleMouseDown = (e: React.MouseEvent) => {
  // Prevent text selection
  e.preventDefault();
  
  // Record when the mouse was pressed
  mouseDownTimeRef.current = Date.now();
  setIsClicking(true);
};

// Handle mouse up - if it was a quick click (not a drag), open details
const handleMouseUp = (e: React.MouseEvent) => {
  // Calculate how long the mouse was pressed
  const clickDuration = Date.now() - mouseDownTimeRef.current;
  
  // If it was a quick click (less than 200ms) and not dragging, treat as a click
  if (isClicking && clickDuration < 200 && !isDragging) {
    onClick();
  }
  
  setIsClicking(false);
};
```

### 2. Updated DndContext Configuration

We simplified the DndContext configuration to focus on core functionality:

```typescript
<DndContext
  sensors={sensors}
  collisionDetection={customCollisionDetection}
  onDragStart={handleDragStart}
  onDragEnd={handleDragEnd}
  // Ensure accurate measurements for better drag positioning
  measuring={{
    droppable: {
      strategy: 'always' // Always measure to ensure accurate collision detection
    }
  }}
  // No modifiers - allow full freedom of movement
>
```

### 3. Adjusted PointerSensor Settings

We updated the sensor configuration to better differentiate between clicks and drags:

```typescript
const sensors = useSensors(
  useSensor(PointerSensor, {
    // Configure the sensor with a delay to differentiate between clicks and drags
    activationConstraint: {
      // Add a small delay to allow for clicks
      delay: 250,
      // Add some tolerance for small movements during clicks
      tolerance: 5,
      // Add a small distance constraint to prevent accidental drags
      distance: 8,
    }
  }),
  useSensor(KeyboardSensor, {
    coordinateGetter: sortableKeyboardCoordinates,
  })
);
```

### 4. Fixed Modal Closing Behavior

We removed the `preventDefault` call in the modal's `onPointerDownOutside` handler:

```typescript
<DialogContent
  className="sm:max-w-[800px] max-h-[90vh] overflow-y-auto"
>
  {/* Modal content */}
</DialogContent>
```

## Lessons Learned

1. **Simplicity Over Complexity**
   - When implementing interactive UI elements, simpler approaches are often more reliable
   - The original implementation tried to be too clever with its click vs. drag detection

2. **Separate Concerns**
   - It's better to clearly separate click handling from drag handling
   - Using time-based detection provides a more intuitive user experience

3. **Test Edge Cases**
   - Interactive elements like drag and drop need thorough testing across different interaction patterns
   - What works for developers may not work for all users

4. **Avoid Event Prevention**
   - Be cautious when using `preventDefault()` or `stopPropagation()` as they can interfere with built-in behaviors
   - In the case of the modal, preventing the default behavior blocked the closing mechanism

## Future Improvements

1. **Drag Previews**
   - Enhance the drag preview to provide better visual feedback during dragging

2. **Accessibility**
   - Add keyboard navigation for the Kanban board
   - Ensure all interactions are accessible to users with disabilities

3. **Touch Support**
   - Optimize the drag and drop experience for touch devices
   - Test and refine on mobile and tablet interfaces
