# Superseded Directory

This directory contains code, components, and files that have been superseded by newer implementations but are kept for reference or potential future use.

## Purpose

- **Archive old code** that might be useful for reference
- **Store duplicate or alternative implementations** that we're not currently using
- **Keep the main codebase clean** while preserving potentially valuable code

## Contents

- **app/** - Superseded app directory components and pages
- **duplicate-frontend-next-files/** - A duplicate frontend-next-files directory that was found at the project root and moved here during code cleanup

## Usage Guidelines

1. **Before adding code here**: Consider if it's truly necessary to keep the code
2. **When adding code**: Add a brief comment or README explaining what the code was for and why it was superseded
3. **When looking for reference**: Check here if you're looking for previous implementations

This directory is not included in the build process and is purely for development reference.
